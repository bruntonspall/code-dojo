    A first test to get things rolling...

    PLEASE CHANGE ANYTHING SHOULD YOU DISAGREE WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE HERE

    This test makes sure there is a function (that you might want to rename) 
    that will appropriately update the game state given the following (that you
    might also want to change - hell, anything is up for grabs here):

    # The state of the board is a list containing nine items. 

    # Each item can be in one of the following states:

        1) "X" = represents a cross
        2) "O" = represents a naught
        3) "_" = represents an empty space

    # Each position in the array maps to the board in the following way:

        0 | 1 | 2
        ---------
        3 | 4 | 5
        ---------
        6 | 7 | 8

    # To place a piece on the board call the function with the position number 
    and type of piece.

    # The function will return a status message and the array representing the
    current state of the game. 

    # The status messages will be one of the following:
        "OK" - you successfully place the piece on a location represented by "_"
        "TAKEN" - you attempted to place a piece on a location already taken
        "BAD TURN" - you attempt to place a piece out of turn
        "FOO WINS" - where FOO is either X or O when they've won the game
